## Course Description

A continuation of CMPSC 100 with an emphasis on implementing, using, and
evaluating the computational structures needed to efficiently store and retrieve
digital data. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork,
students create data structures and algorithms whose correctness and performance
they study through proofs and experimentation. Students continue to refine their
ability to organize and document a program's source code so that it effectively
communicates with the intended users and maintainers. During a weekly laboratory
session, students use state-of-the-art technology to complete projects,
reporting on their results through both written documents and oral
presentations.

- Prerequisite: CMPSC 100 or permission of the instructor.
- Distribution Requirements: QR, SP.

## Course Learning Objectives

1. When solving a problem with a Python program, accurately describe data structures and algorithms and their inherent trade-offs.
2. Use data structures and algorithms to correctly and efficiently solve a problem through the use of a Python program.
3. Use empirical methods to characterize the performance of a Python program that uses data structures and algorithms.
4. Use industry-standard practices, such as testing and debugging, and professional-grade integrated development environments (IDEs), command-line tools, and version control systems to implement Python programs.
5. Implement Python programs and documentation that conforms to industry-standard formats and styles.

### Further Objectives

**Quantitative Reasoning (QR)**: Quantitative Reasoning is the ability to understand,
investigate, communicate, and contextualize numerical, symbolic, and graphical information
towards the exploration of natural, physical, behavioral, or social phenomena.

*Learning Outcome*: Students who successfully complete this requirement will demonstrate
an understanding of how to interpret numeric data and/or their graphical or symbolic
representations.

**Scientific Process and Knowledge (SP)**: Courses involving Scientific Process and Knowledge
aim to convey an understanding of what is known or can be known about the natural world;
apply scientific reasoning towards the analysis and synthesis of scientific information; and
create scientifically literate citizens who can engage productively in problem solving.

*Learning Outcome*: Students who successfully complete this requirement will demonstrate an
understanding of the nature, approaches, and domain of scientific inquiry.

## Course Policies

### Grading

The grade that a student receives in this class will be based on the following
categories. All of these percentages are approximate and, if the need to do so
presents itself, the course instructor may change the assigned percentages
during the academic semester.

| Category             | Repeats |Unit Value| Total Percentage |
|----------------------|---------|----------|------------------|
| Attendance (7 free)  |50       |0.12%      |6%                |
| Midterm Examinations |2        |6%        |12%               |
| Final Examination    |1        |18%       |18%               |
| Specification Labs         |8        |2%        |16%               |
| Engineering Labs     |8        |4%        |32%               |
| Lab Reflections      |16       |1%        |16%               |

These grading categories have the following definitions:

-   **Attendance**: Students are expected to regularly attend and
    actively participate in all class and laboratory sessions. Attendance
    is determined by the completion of in-class materials. See the Attendance Policy below
    for further elaboration on attendance expectations.

-   **Midterm Examinations**: The midterms are cumulative assessments
    covering all prior material from the class, programming, and laboratory
    sessions, as outlined on the course schedule. All students should take
    this test on the scheduled date and complete it in the stated location
    while taking no more than the required amount of time. Instructions about the
    format of each midterm will be provided at least one week before each exam.

-   **Final Examination**: The final is a cumulative assessment covering
    all of the material from the class, programming, and laboratory sessions, as
    outlined on the course schedule. All students should take this test on the
    scheduled date and to complete it in the stated location while taking no
    more than the required amount of time. Instructions about the
    format of the final will be provided at least one week before the exam.

-   **Specification Labs**: Graded on a check mark basis, all or nothing.
    Specification Labs, or Spec Labs for shprt, (i) help a learner to demonstrate that they can remember
    learned material
    by recalling facts, basic concepts, and answers to questions presented in
    the textbook and in course materials; (ii) allow a learner to
    demonstrate an understanding of facts and ideas by translating,
    interpreting, and stating the main technical ideas presented through the
    textbook and course materials; (iii) further equip a
    learner to solve new problems in the field of computer science by applying
    &mdash; in a new way &mdash; their knowledge of the facts and techniques related to
    data structures and rigorous Python programming.

-   **Engineering Labs**: Graded on a percentage basis.
    Engineering Labs invite students to explore
    different techniques for rigorously designing, implementing, evaluating, and
    documenting real-world Python programs. These assignments also encourage
    students to use tools like a terminal window and a modern
    Python development environment to implement functions that strike the right
    balance between understandability, generalizability, and specialization.
    Students will also use the data collected from running experiments to
    evaluate the implementation of a Python function as they consider trade-offs
    between, for instance, its efficiency, flexibility, and correctness.

### Assignment Evaluation

You will privately receive a grade for each assignment in Canvas. Your grade will be a function of whether or not you completed the work that correctly fulfills the assignment's specification and submitted it by the deadline.

**Engineering Labs** are graded, i.e. assigned a number or percentage
indicative of the proportion of points earned relative to the total possible.
Fifty percent of the grade of each Engineering Lab is determined by
the percentage of gatorgrade checks passed. One quarter of the grade is determined by code correctness following a rubric. One quarter of the grade is determined by professional
presentation following a rubric. Professional presentation is impacted by linting,
formatting, testing, profiling, duplication avoidance and commenting.

**Spec Labs** are pass/fail. A full mark is earned by
passing **100%** of the gatorgrade checks on the assignment. All
other gatorgrade scores will earn 0 points.

### Assignment Submission

All assignments will have a stated due date stated in the
Course Materials Schedule, GitHub
Classroom, and Discord. Electronic versions of the Engineering and Project Labs
must be submitted to the
instructor through a student's GitHub repository created by GitHub Classroom. No
credit will be awarded for any course work that you submit to the incorrect
GitHub repository.

### Late Work Policy

The deadlines for assignments are hard deadlines.

This policy is intended to ensure that students keep up with course topics, are able to actively participate in class, and are accountable for managing time effectively. Some assignments will be dropped automatically without penalty. Students may use this policy if they are unable to turn in work due to non-extenuating circumstances.

### Course Attendance

It is mandatory for all students to attend the course sessions. If, due to
extenuating circumstances, you will not be able to attend a session, then,
whenever possible, please communicate with the instructor at least one week in
advance to describe your situation. Students who have any signs of illness
should not attend any in-person course sessions.

### Class Preparation

In order to maximize learning, students must invest time
to prepare for the class discussions, laboratory, and programming sessions.
During the class periods, the course instructor will often pose challenging
questions that could require group discussion, the creation of a Python program, a vote on a thought-provoking issue, or an in-class
presentation. Students should prepare by reading the
assigned material and reviewing the current course projects to effectively participate in these class discussions.

During the class sessions students will also be required to download, use,
and modify Python software components and data sets that are made available through
means such as the Proactive Programmers web site or a GitHub repository.

### Using GitHub and Discord

This course will primarily use GitHub and Discord for all course communication.
We will use GitHub for managing and viewing source code, and for reporting
issues in those materials. The
[Allegheny College Computer and Information Science Discord
Server](https://discord.gg/CS2h9kXzX6) will be the main forum for announcements
and technical discussions about Data Structures and departmental activities
including TL office hours.

### Using Email

Although we will primarily use Discord for class communication, the course
instructor will sometimes use email to send announcements about important
matters such as changes in the schedule. It is your responsibility to check your
email at least once a day and to ensure that you can reliably send and receive
emails. This class policy is based on the statement about the use of email that
appears in *The Compass*, the College's student handbook; please see the
instructor if you do not have this handbook.

### Honor Code

The Academic Honor Program that governs the entire academic program at
Allegheny College is described in the Allegheny Academic Bulletin. The Honor
Program applies to all work that is submitted for academic credit or to meet
non-credit requirements for graduation at Allegheny College. This includes all
work assigned for this class (e.g., examinations and course assignments). All
students who have enrolled in the College will work under the Honor Program.
Each student who has matriculated at the College has acknowledged the following
Honor Code pledge:

> I hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as
> defined in the Honor Code, and to maintain the integrity of both
> myself and the College community as a whole.

### Effective Collaboration

Computer science is an inherently collaborative discipline. People must work
together to produce large, complex, and ultimately useful software systems.
Because of this, the Department of Computer and Information Science at Allegheny College
encourages students to engage in collaboration. However, in the context of
individual coursework, through which each student must demonstrate their own
knowledge, there are certain forms of collaboration that are and are not
acceptable.

- Acceptable forms of collaboration include:
    - Discussing high-level concepts, such as the use cases for `while` loops
      or the various methods that can add elements to a `list`.
    - Referring someone to a course text book, course slides, example programs,
      or other resources that contain helpful information or instructions.
    - Outlining the high-level steps to solving a problem or implementing a
      feature, without mentioning specific lines of code that need to be
      written.

- Unacceptable forms of collaboration include:
    - Sharing details about specific lines of code, including showing your
      source code to someone or looking at someone else's code.
    - Copying someone else's source code, technical writing, program commands,
      or program output, even with some slight modifications.
    - Typing source code, technical writing, or commands on someone else’s
      computer.

The aforementioned forms of communication are unacceptable because they make it
difficult for both the course instructor and a learner to assess individual
knowledge. Moreover, these unacceptable forms of collaboration can impede your
learning or someone else's learning since an individual is less likely to
understand source code or technical writing that they do not create
themselves. Any student who participates in these unacceptable forms of
collaboration, whether they are the one sharing, showing, looking, copying, or
typing, are in violation of Allegheny College's Honor Code.

In summary, students should collaborate as long as they do so in acceptable
ways. If a student needs assistance beyond what can be gained through
acceptable forms of collaboration, they should seek help from the course
instructor or a technical leader. If a student submits deliverables (e.g.,
source code or technical writing) that are nearly identical to the work of
others, this will be taken as evidence of violating the Honor Code.

### Seeking Assistance

Students who are struggling to understand the knowledge and skills developed in
either a class, laboratory, or programming session are encouraged to seek
assistance from the course instructor and the student technical leaders.
Students should, within the bounds of the Honor Code, ask and answer questions
on the #data-structures Discord channel. The Discord channel is preferred to make
learning and teaching collaborative. Students can find out the
office hour schedule for student TLs in the
[CIS Discord Server](https://discord.gg/CS2h9kXzX6) under #tl-office-hours, or
book appointments for office hours with the instructor.

For exams and all other coursework, students are expected 
to adhere to the given instructions specifying what is or is not considered authorized 
assistance for the particular exam or item of coursework. It is the responsibility of the student to 
review the authorization specifications on every item and act appropriately, 
upholding the honor code.  Unauthorized assistance may or may not preclude 1. internet use, 
including but not limited to online large language models (e.g. ChatGTP); 2. offline artificial intelligence 
tools; 3. textbooks; 4. other specifically named materials or sources. Students are 
reminded to review Honor Code Article III Section 1, requiring students who know that 
an honor code violation has occurred to report the violation. Moreover, "Failure to do 
so is as injurious to the honor of the College community as is the observed act of 
dishonesty and constitutes an infraction of the Honor Code."

### Educational Accommodations

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination
statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with
disabilities. Among other things, this legislation requires all students with
disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable
accommodation of their disabilities. Students with disabilities who believe they
may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact Student 
Accessibility and Support Services (SASS) at 814-332-2898. Student Accessibility 
and Support Services is part of the Learning Commons
and is located in Pelletier Library. Please do this as soon as possible to
ensure that approved accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.
