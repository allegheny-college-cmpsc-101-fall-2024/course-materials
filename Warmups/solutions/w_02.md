# Warmup questions

## What concept is being demonstrated below?

```python
a = [81, 82, 83]
b = a
b.append(84)
print('The list a is:', a)
print('The list b is:', b)
print('checking if a is b:', a is b)
```

Aliasing: more than one variable name is bound to the same object.

## What methods can you use to make the expression in last print statement evaluate to `False`?

In order to make `a is b` evaluate to `False`, they have to bound to two
separate objects, i.e. they cannot be aliased to the same object.

```python
a = [81, 82, 83]
# this only works for simple lists, not compound lists
b = a.copy()
```

```python
import copy
a = [81, 82, 83]
# this always works
b = copy.deepcopy(a)
```

```python
a = [81, 82, 83]
# this only works for simple lists, not compound lists
b = a[:]
```
